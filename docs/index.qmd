title: "Making, Updating, and Querying Causal Models with [CausalQueries]{.pkg}"
abstract: "The [R]{.proglang} package [CausalQueries]{.pkg}  can be used to make, update, and query causal models defined on binary nodes. Users provide a causal statement of the form `X -> M <- Y; M <-> Y` which is interpreted as a structural causal model over a collection of binary nodes.  Then [CausalQueries]{.pkg} allows users to (1) identify the set of principal strata---causal types---required to characterize all possible causal relations between nodes that are consistent with the causal statement (2) determine a set of parameters needed to characterize distributions over these causal types (3) update beliefs over distributions of causal types, using a `stan` model plus data, and (4) pose a wide range of causal queries of the model, using either the prior distribution, the posterior distribution, or a user-specified candidate vector of parameters."
